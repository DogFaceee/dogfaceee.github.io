<p>Our base of operations doesn't have an address, but if you'd like to send us something please write these instructions on the envelope:</p>

<address>TO: Mossy Rock Network HQ<br>C/O Lonesome Ken<br> DEILVERY INSTRUCTIONS: Start Boston Creek, ON., heading east on the main road with no name or number designation. Keep heading east and sometimes north until you've passed 3 seperate township lines. Turn left at the blue sign with the holes in it. NOT the blue sign without holes. If you hit Modelessardo township line, you've gone too far. Proceed 15 km and at the ditch exit your vehicle. Proceed north 7.2 km. Once you pass the Tamarack with the broken branch and the knot that looks like a beautiful woman, listen for the waterfall and follow it but not too far. If you walk so far that you can see the waterfall, walk back about 45 meters and you should see the Mossy Rock Headquarters through the gap in the undergrowth. Keep an eye out for the green and brown sign. Welcome! The door is unlocked so just toss this package through the door and grab a refreshment from the fridge (from the middle shelf ONLY). Hydration is very important.
<br>Boston Creek, ON. <br>Canada <br>P0K 1TO

<p class="center">We look forward to hearing from you!</p>
